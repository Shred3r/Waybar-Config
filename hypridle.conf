# This listener will trigger the hyprlock command after a short period of inactivity.

# This listener will suspend the system after a longer period of inactivity.

# Listener 3: DPMS (Display Power Management Signaling)
# This listener controls the display power state, turning off the screen.

# it can be explicitly set here if needed or for different behaviors.
